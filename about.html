                    <h2>Born in the Mountains, Trusted Everywhere.</h2>
                    <p>Equinox Audio Visuals was founded in Manchester, Vermont, with a simple idea: event production could be better. Better tech, yes, but also a better, more human experience. We saw an industry full of vendors and wanted to be a partner.</p>
                    <p>We built our company on a foundation of radical accountability and a hospitality mindset. We're the "cool kids, nice guys" of AV—the team you can trust to obsess over every detail and the one you'll actually enjoy working with from the first call to the final load-out. Our roots are here in Vermont, but our work and our reputation take us all over the world.</p>
